## GPT-2
How to build and train a LLM like GPT-2, some notes and some codes.

## Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xiao-Xianghong/GPT-2/
cd GPT-2
```

## Environment and dependence
- Python 3.10
- PyTorch 2.5.1
- CUDA 13.1

Install PyTorch according to your CUDA version:
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

run this code in bash to install dependences
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
We use the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, a widely used and well-established dataset for language modeling tasks.

## Training Details
The batch size is set to 4 due to GPU memory constraints (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU with 8GB VRAM).

If you have access to a GPU with larger memory, increasing the batch size may help accelerate training.

The model is trained for 500 epochs, and checkpoints are saved every 250 epochs.
